# Discord.py-YouTubeTutorialSeries

This is a repository that houses all the files from every episode of my YouTube series on creating a Python discord Bot.
Even if you copy and paste or download the files directly from this github repository, you may experience python errors. To fix these you must watch the episodes in order, as you may need to install new things for the code to work e.g Youtube_dl or FFMPEG.

Thanks,
